# Pricing

This page provides the details of the cost and licensing of each extension. You can use it in both Sandbox and Production environments, depending on your needs. However, the trial mode has some limitations: you can only create up to 2 API pages with 5 fields in total. If you want to unlock the full potential of our extension, you need to get a license.

To get a license, please [contact us through the form on our website](https://www.fusion5.com.au/contact-us/). We will get back to you with a quote and the steps to activate your license.
