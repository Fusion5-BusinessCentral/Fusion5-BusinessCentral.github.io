## How to use

Vendor BPAY Accounts can be specified under **Vendor BPAY Accounts** available from **Vendor Card**

![BPAY-VendorBankAccount.png](./img/Vendor-BPAY-Accounts.png)

If a vendor has more than one BPAY account, you can specify which one should be used by default on the vendor card on the tab Payments, field **Preferred BPAY Account Code**.

Purchase Order/Invoice has a new section **BPAY** in the tab **Shipping and Payment**. Values are preselected from the vendor card (from **Preferred BPAY Account Code**) and could be changed in the document. Once a document is posted, values are transferred to **Posted Purchase Invoice** and **Vendor Ledger Entries**.

BPAY details in **Vendor Ledger Entries** that are **Open** = **Yes** are editable. 

**Payment Journal** Functionality is done similarly to **EFT Payments**
